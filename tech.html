          <h1>What is Vue?</h1>
          <article>
            <p>
              Vue (pronounced /vju:/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for
              building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS
              and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based
              programming model that helps you efficiently develop user
              interfaces, be it simple or complex.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a minimal example:</p>
            <code
              >import { createApp } from 'vue' createApp({ data() { return {
              count: 0 } } }).mount('#app')
            </code>
            <code
              ><div id="app">
                <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
              </div>
            </code>
            <p>The above example demonstrates the two core features of Vue:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Declarative Rendering:</b>Vue extends standard HTML with a
                template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML
                output based on JavaScript state.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Reactivity:</b> Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state
                changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every
              little detail in the rest of the documentation. For now, please
              read along so you can have a high-level understanding of what Vue
              offers.

                The rest of the documentation assumes basic familiarity with
                HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend
                development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a
                framework as your first step - grasp the basics and then come
                back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not
                required.

          <h1>The Progressive Framework</h1>
          <article>
            <p>
              Vue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common
              features needed in frontend development. But the web is extremely
              diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in
              form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible
              and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can
              be used in different ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enhancing static HTML without a build step</li>
              <li>Embedding as Web Components on any page</li>
              <li>Single-Page Application (SPA)</li>
              <li>Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</li>
              <li>Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)</li>
              <li>Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial
              and guide only require basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge, and
              you should be able to follow along without being an expert in any
              of these.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are an experienced developer interested in how to best
              integrate Vue into your stack, or you are curious about what these
              terms mean, we discuss them in more details in
              <span
                ><a

                  >Ways of Using Vue</a
                ></span
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is
              shared across all these use cases. Even if you are just a beginner
              now, the knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you
              grow to tackle more ambitious goals in the future. If you are a
              veteran, you can pick the optimal way to leverage Vue based on the
              problems you are trying to solve, while retaining the same
              productivity. This is why we call Vue "The Progressive Framework":
              it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt to your needs.

          <h1>Single-File Components</h1>
          <article>
            <p>In most build-tool-enabled Vue projects, we author Vue components using an HTML-like file format called Single-File Component (also known as <code>*.vue</code> files, abbreviated as SFC). A Vue SFC, as the name suggests, encapsulates the component's logic (JavaScript), template (HTML), and styles (CSS) in a single file. Here's the previous example, written in SFC format:</p>
            <code>
                <script>
                export default {
                  data() {
                    return {
                      count: 0
                    }
                  }
                }
                </script>
                
                <template>
                  <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
                </template>
                
                <style scoped>
                button {
                  font-weight: bold;
                }
                </style>
            </code>
          </article>

          <h1>API Styles</h1>
          <p>Vue components can be authored in two different API styles: Options API and Composition API.</p>
